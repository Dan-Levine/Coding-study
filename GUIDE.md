## Core Data Structures

Data structures are the building blocks of efficient algorithms. Choosing the right one is half the battle. This section covers the fundamental structures, their operations, complexities, and common use cases, informed by comprehensive resources like the Tech Interview Handbook.[^3]

### Arrays & Strings

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Think of an array as a list of items in a numbered sequence, like a grocery list. A string is just an array of characters. You've used them countless times. Now, let's analyze them from a performance perspective.

*   **Demonstration:**
    Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory. This is their superpower and their Achilles' heel.

    *   **Access:** Instantaneous, since we can calculate the memory address of any element with a simple formula: `start_address + (index * element_size)`. This is why array access is $O(1)$.
    *   **Insertion/Deletion:** Can be slow. If you insert at the beginning, you have to shift every other element to the right. This is an $O(n)$ operation, where $n$ is the number of elements.

    **Python Implementation:** Python's `list` is a dynamic array, which means it automatically resizes itself as you add more elements.

    ~~~python
    # Python's list serves as a dynamic array
    # Time Complexity: Access O(1), Append O(1) amortized, Insert/Delete O(n)
    # Space Complexity: O(n)

    # Create a list
    my_list: list[int] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

    # Access (O(1))
    print(my_list[2])  # Output: 30

    # Append (O(1) amortized)
    my_list.append(60)

    # Insert at index 1 (O(n))
    my_list.insert(1, 15)

    # Delete at index 3 (O(n))
    del my_list[3]

    print(my_list) # Output: [10, 15, 20, 40, 50, 60]
    ~~~

    💡 **Tip:** In Python, strings are immutable. Any "modification" creates a new string, which can be inefficient in a loop. For building strings iteratively, use a list of characters and `''.join()` them at the end.

*   **Takeaway:** Arrays offer fast access but slow insertion/deletion, making them ideal for read-heavy tasks or when you're adding to the end.

### Hash Maps (Dictionaries)

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** If you've ever used a dictionary to look up a word's definition, you understand hash maps. They store key-value pairs, allowing for incredibly fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.

*   **Demonstration:**
    A hash map uses a *hash function* to convert a key into an index in an underlying array. This is how it achieves its near-instant performance.

    *   **Lookup/Insertion/Deletion:** On average, these operations are $O(1)$. The hash function computes the index, and we access it directly.
    *   **Worst Case:** If the hash function is poor or you're unlucky, multiple keys can map to the same index. This is called a *collision*. Most hash maps handle this by storing a linked list at that index, degrading performance to $O(n)$ in the worst case. A good hash function makes this rare.

    **Python Implementation:** Python's `dict` is a highly optimized hash map. The `collections.Counter` subclass is particularly useful for counting frequencies.

    ~~~python
    # Python's dict is a hash map
    # Time Complexity: Access/Insert/Delete O(1) average, O(n) worst case
    # Space Complexity: O(n)

    # Create a dictionary
    user_ages: dict[str, int] = {"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25}

    # Access (O(1) average)
    print(user_ages["Alice"]) # Output: 30

    # Insert (O(1) average)
    user_ages["Charlie"] = 35

    # Delete (O(1) average)
    del user_ages["Bob"]

    # Using collections.Counter for frequency counting
    from collections import Counter
    word_counts = Counter("hello world")
    print(word_counts['l']) # Output: 3
    ~~~

    ⚠️ **Pitfall:** Dictionary keys in Python must be *hashable*, meaning they must be immutable. Lists and other dictionaries cannot be keys, but tuples can.

*   **Takeaway:** Hash maps are the go-to for fast lookups, making them perfect for frequency counts, caching (memoization), and any problem that requires checking for the existence of an item.

### Linked Lists

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Imagine a scavenger hunt where each clue tells you where to find the next one. That's a linked list. Each element (a *node*) doesn't live in a contiguous block of memory; instead, it holds a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

*   **Demonstration:**
    This structure excels where arrays falter: insertion and deletion.

    *   **Access:** To find the $i$-th element, you must traverse the list from the beginning, one node at a time. This is an $O(i)$ operation.
    *   **Insertion/Deletion:** Fast, provided you have a reference to the node you want to modify. You just need to change a couple of pointers. This is an $O(1)$ operation.

    There are two main types:
    1.  **Singly Linked List:** Each node points only to the next node.
    2.  **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next and the previous node, making backward traversal possible.

    **Python Implementation:** While Python doesn't have a built-in linked list, they are simple to construct and are a common interview topic.

    ~~~python
    # A simple Node class for a singly linked list
    # Time Complexity: Access O(i), Insert/Delete O(1) (with node reference)
    # Space Complexity: O(n)

    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value: int, next_node: 'Node' = None):
            self.value = value
            self.next = next_node

    # Create a simple linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3
    head = Node(1, Node(2, Node(3)))

    # Traverse the list
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None") # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
    ~~~

    💡 **Tip:** Problems involving reversing a linked list, detecting cycles (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm), or finding the middle element are classic linked list patterns.

*   **Takeaway:** Linked lists shine in scenarios requiring frequent insertions and deletions, especially when you don't need random access to elements.

### Stacks & Queues

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** A stack is like a pile of plates: you add to the top and take from the top (Last-In, First-Out or LIFO). A queue is like a line at a checkout counter: you join at the back and are served from the front (First-In, First-Out or FIFO).

*   **Demonstration:**
    Stacks and queues are abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. However, they are defined by their specific interface for adding and removing elements.

    *   **Stack Operations:** `push` (add to top), `pop` (remove from top).
    *   **Queue Operations:** `enqueue` (add to back), `dequeue` (remove from front).

    **Python Implementation:** While a `list` can be used as a stack (`append` for push, `pop` for pop), it's inefficient as a queue because removing from the front is $O(n)$. The best tool for both is `collections.deque` (pronounced "deck"), which is a doubly-ended queue optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

    ~~~python
    from collections import deque
    from typing import Deque

    # Using deque for a stack (LIFO)
    # Time Complexity: Push/Pop O(1)
    # Space Complexity: O(n)
    stack: Deque[int] = deque()
    stack.append(1)  # Push
    stack.append(2)
    stack.pop()      # Pop -> returns 2

    # Using deque for a queue (FIFO)
    # Time Complexity: Enqueue/Dequeue O(1)
    # Space Complexity: O(n)
    queue: Deque[int] = deque()
    queue.append(1)      # Enqueue
    queue.append(2)
    queue.popleft()      # Dequeue -> returns 1
    ~~~

    💡 **Tip:** Stacks are fundamental to Depth-First Search (DFS) and for problems involving matching parentheses or expression evaluation. Queues are the backbone of Breadth-First Search (BFS).

*   **Takeaway:** Use a stack for LIFO logic (e.g., reversing order, traversing deeply) and a queue for FIFO logic (e.g., processing in order of arrival, exploring level by level). `collections.deque` is your best friend for both in Python.

### Trees, Tries, & Heaps

This trio represents more specialized, non-linear structures that are crucial for solving certain classes of problems efficiently.

#### Trees

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Think of a family tree or a file system directory. A tree is a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes. A *Binary Tree* is a common variant where each node has at most two children. A *Binary Search Tree (BST)* is a sorted binary tree, where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger.

*   **Demonstration:**
    Trees are defined by their traversal algorithms:
    *   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Goes as deep as possible down one branch before backtracking. The main types are In-order (Left, Root, Right), Pre-order (Root, Left, Right), and Post-order (Left, Right, Root).
    *   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores level by level, using a queue.

    **Python Implementation:** Like linked lists, trees are often implemented with a `Node` class.

    ~~~python
    # A simple TreeNode class for a binary tree
    # Time Complexity: Search/Insert/Delete is O(h), where h is the height.
    # For a balanced tree, h = log(n), so O(log n). For an unbalanced tree, h = n, so O(n).
    # Space Complexity: O(n)

    class TreeNode:
        def __init__(self, value: int, left: 'TreeNode' = None, right: 'TreeNode' = None):
            self.value = value
            self.left = left
            self.right = right

    # Example of in-order traversal (DFS)
    def in_order_traversal(node: TreeNode | None):
        if not node:
            return
        in_order_traversal(node.left)
        print(node.value, end=" ")
        in_order_traversal(node.right)
    ~~~

#### Tries (Prefix Trees)

*   **Demonstration:** A trie is a special type of tree used for storing strings, optimized for prefix-based searches. Each node represents a character, and paths from the root spell out words. They are the data structure behind autocomplete features. Insertion and search are very fast, proportional to the length of the string ($O(k)$), not the number of words.

#### Heaps (Priority Queues)

*   **Demonstration:** A heap is a tree-based structure that satisfies the *heap property*: in a *min-heap*, the parent is always smaller than its children; in a *max-heap*, it's always larger. This structure makes it incredibly efficient to find the min/max element. This is why heaps are synonymous with *Priority Queues*.

    **Python Implementation:** Python's `heapq` module implements a min-heap. To simulate a max-heap, store negated values.

    ~~~python
    import heapq

    # A min-heap using heapq
    # Time Complexity: Push O(log n), Pop O(log n), Peek O(1)
    # Space Complexity: O(n)
    min_heap: list[int] = []
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, 5)
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, 1)
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, 9)

    # Peek at the smallest element
    print(min_heap[0]) # Output: 1

    # Pop the smallest element
    smallest = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    print(smallest) # Output: 1
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** Use trees for hierarchical data, BSTs for sorted data, tries for prefix searches, and heaps for problems involving priority (e.g., "find the top K elements," or Dijkstra's algorithm).

### Graphs

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Think of a social network or a map of city roads. A graph is a collection of nodes (*vertices*) connected by edges. They can be *directed* (like a one-way street) or *undirected* (like a two-way street).

*   **Demonstration:**
    The most common way to represent a graph in an interview is with an **adjacency list**, which is a hash map where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors.

    Graph traversal is key. The two main algorithms are:
    1.  **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores neighbors first (level by level). Uses a queue. Great for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
    2.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Goes deep down a path before exploring other paths. Uses a stack (or recursion). Great for detecting cycles or exploring all possibilities.

    **Visualizing BFS vs. DFS:**

    ~~~mermaid
    graph TD
        subgraph BFS - Level by Level
            A[Start] --> B[1]
            A --> C[1]
            B --> D[2]
            B --> E[2]
            C --> F[2]
        end
        subgraph DFS - Deep Dive
            G[Start] --> H[1]
            H --> I[2]
            I --> J[3]
            J --> K[4]
            H --> L[2]
        end
    ~~~
    *Caption: BFS explores nodes 1 level at a time, while DFS follows a path to its end before backtracking.*

    **Python Implementation:** An adjacency list is easily implemented with a dictionary.

    ~~~python
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Adjacency list representation
    # Time Complexity: Varies by algorithm. Traversal is O(V+E) where V is vertices, E is edges.
    # Space Complexity: O(V+E)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("A", "C"), ("C", "D")]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u) # For an undirected graph

    # Example of a simple DFS traversal
    def dfs(node, visited, graph):
        if node in visited:
            return
        visited.add(node)
        print(node, end=" ")
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(neighbor, visited, graph)

    visited = set()
    dfs("A", visited, graph) # Possible output: A B C D
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** Graphs model complex relationships. Master BFS and DFS, as they are the foundation for nearly all other graph algorithms (like Dijkstra's and topological sort).

## Core Algorithms & Problem-Solving Patterns

With data structures as our building blocks, we now turn to the patterns and algorithms that use them to solve problems. Recognizing these patterns is the key to unlocking difficult questions quickly.[^3]

### Sorting & Searching

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** You've sorted a list of numbers and searched for a name in a phone book. These fundamental tasks have been studied for decades, leading to highly optimized algorithms.

*   **Demonstration:**

    **Sorting:** While it's important to understand how algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort work, in a timed assessment, you will almost always use the built-in sorting function. The key is to know its time complexity.

    *   **Python's `sort()` and `sorted()`:** Both use Timsort, a hybrid algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Its average and worst-case time complexity is an excellent $O(n \log n)$.

    **Searching:** If your data is sorted, you can do much better than a linear scan ($O(n)$).

    *   **Binary Search:** This is the classic "divide and conquer" algorithm. By repeatedly dividing the search space in half, it can find an element in a sorted array in $O(\log n)$ time.

    **The Binary Search Recurrence Relation:**
    The work done at each step is constant (finding the middle), and the problem size is halved. This gives us the recurrence relation:
    $$ T(n) = T(n/2) + c $$
    This resolves to $O(\log n)$.

    **Python Implementation:** While you can write binary search by hand, Python's `bisect` module is a robust, built-in alternative.

    ~~~python
    import bisect

    # Using bisect for searching in a sorted array
    # Time Complexity: O(log n)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
    sorted_arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

    # Find the index to insert 35 to maintain sort order
    index = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_arr, 35) # returns 3

    # Check if an element exists
    def does_exist(arr, val):
        i = bisect.bisect_left(arr, val)
        return i != len(arr) and arr[i] == val

    print(does_exist(sorted_arr, 30)) # Output: True
    print(does_exist(sorted_arr, 35)) # Output: False
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** Always use the built-in $O(n \log n)$ sort. If you encounter a problem with a sorted array, your first thought should be binary search for an $O(\log n)$ lookup.

### Two Pointers

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Imagine two people reading the same book, one from the front and one from the back, looking for a pair of words that meet a certain condition. This is the essence of the two-pointers pattern. It's a way to iterate through an array with two different indices at the same time.

*   **Demonstration:**
    This pattern is most often used on sorted arrays to find a pair of elements that satisfy a condition. By starting pointers at the beginning (`left`) and end (`right`), you can cleverly narrow down the search space.

    **Visualizing the Two-Pointer Decision:**

    ~~~mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Start: L=0, R=n-1] --> B{arr[L] + arr[R] == target?};
        B -- Yes --> C[Found! Return true];
        B -- No --> D{arr[L] + arr[R] > target?};
        D -- Yes --> E[Sum is too big.<br/>Decrement R to reduce sum];
        D -- No --> F[Sum is too small.<br/>Increment L to increase sum];
        E --> G{L < R?};
        F --> G;
        G -- Yes --> B;
        G -- No --> H[Not Found. Return false];
    ~~~
    *Caption: The logic for moving the left and right pointers based on the current sum.*

    **Python Implementation:** The code is often very clean and efficient.

    ~~~python
    # Find if a pair sums to a target in a sorted array
    # Time Complexity: O(n)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)

    def has_pair_with_sum(arr: list[int], target: int) -> bool:
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while left < right:
            current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
            if current_sum == target:
                return True
            elif current_sum > target:
                right -= 1 # Sum is too high, need a smaller number
            else:
                left += 1 # Sum is too low, need a larger number
        return False

    print(has_pair_with_sum([1, 2, 4, 6, 9], 8)) # Output: True (2+6)
    print(has_pair_with_sum([1, 2, 4, 6, 9], 12)) # Output: False
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** When given a sorted array and asked to find a pair of elements, the two-pointers pattern is almost always the optimal $O(n)$ solution.

### Sliding Window

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Think about finding the busiest one-hour period in a day by sliding a one-hour "window" across a timeline of events. The sliding window pattern applies this idea to arrays and strings, allowing you to efficiently calculate properties of a contiguous block of elements.

*   **Demonstration:**
    This pattern avoids redundant calculations. Instead of re-computing the value for each new window, you cleverly add the new element and subtract the element that just left the window. This reduces a potentially $O(n \cdot k)$ brute-force approach to a clean $O(n)$.

    **Visualizing the Sliding Window:**

    ~~~mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Array as arr
        participant Window as W
        participant Sum as S

        loop i from 0 to n-k
            Note over Array, Window: Initial window [i...i+k-1]
            Window->>Sum: Calculate sum of first window
            Note over Array, Window: Slide window to the right
            Window->>Sum: S = S - arr[i] + arr[i+k]
            Note over Window, Sum: Update max_sum
        end
    ~~~
    *Caption: The window slides one element at a time, updating the sum in O(1) by subtracting the outgoing element and adding the incoming one.*

    **Python Implementation:**

    ~~~python
    # Find the max sum of any contiguous subarray of size k
    # Time Complexity: O(n)
    # Space Complexity: O(1)

    def max_sum_subarray(arr: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        if len(arr) < k:
            return -1

        window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
        max_sum = window_sum

        for i in range(len(arr) - k):
            # "Slide" the window by subtracting the leftmost element
            # and adding the new rightmost element.
            window_sum = window_sum - arr[i] + arr[i + k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

        return max_sum

    print(max_sum_subarray([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3)) # Output: 9 (from [5, 1, 3])
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** If a problem asks for the "longest," "shortest," or "best" contiguous subarray or substring, think sliding window.

### Recursion & Backtracking

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Recursion is a function that calls itself. Think of Russian nesting dolls. Backtracking is a form of recursion that intelligently explores all possible solutions to a problem and "backs up" as soon as it knows a path won't work. It's like navigating a maze.

*   **Demonstration:**
    Backtracking is often used for problems that ask for all possible solutions, like generating permutations, combinations, or solving Sudoku. The general pattern is:
    1.  **Choose:** Make a choice (e.g., pick a number to add to the permutation).
    2.  **Explore:** Recursively call the function with the new choice.
    3.  **Un-choose:** Backtrack by undoing the choice, allowing you to explore other paths.

    **The Fibonacci Sequence Recurrence Relation:**
    A classic, albeit inefficient, example of recursion is calculating Fibonacci numbers.
    $$ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) $$
    This is a tree-recursive process with an exponential time complexity of $O(2^n)$.

    **Python Implementation (Permutations):**

    ~~~python
    # Generate all permutations of a list of numbers
    # Time Complexity: O(n * n!) - n! permutations, and it takes O(n) to copy each one.
    # Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion depth

    def find_permutations(nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
        result = []

        def backtrack(start: int):
            if start == len(nums):
                result.append(list(nums))
                return

            for i in range(start, len(nums)):
                # Choose: swap elements
                nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]

                # Explore
                backtrack(start + 1)

                # Un-choose: swap back
                nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]

        backtrack(0)
        return result

    print(find_permutations([1, 2, 3]))
    # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 2, 1], [3, 1, 2]]
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** When a problem asks to "find all possible..." or involves solving a puzzle (like a maze or Sudoku), backtracking is a strong candidate. Draw the recursion tree to understand the state at each step.

### Dynamic Programming

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Dynamic Programming (DP) is essentially "recursion with a memory." Remember the inefficient $O(2^n)$ Fibonacci calculation? It re-calculates the same values over and over. DP solves this by storing the results of subproblems so you only have to compute them once.

*   **Demonstration:**
    DP is applicable when a problem has:
    1.  **Overlapping Subproblems:** Solutions to subproblems are reused multiple times.
    2.  **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

    There are two main approaches:
    1.  **Top-Down (Memoization):** Write a standard recursive function, but cache the results in a hash map or array. If you encounter a subproblem you've already solved, return the cached value.
    2.  **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):** Solve the problem "iteratively" by filling up a table, starting from the smallest subproblems and building up to the final solution.

    **Visualizing the DP Dependency Graph (Fibonacci):**
    A naive recursive solution creates a tree of calls. DP collapses this into a linear sequence.

    ~~~mermaid
    graph TD
        subgraph "Naive Recursion (O(2^n))"
            F5 --> F4
            F5 --> F3
            F4 --> F3
            F4 --> F2
        end
        subgraph "DP (O(n))"
            style F3_DP fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
            F5_DP[F(5)] --> F4_DP[F(4)]
            F5_DP --> F3_DP[F(3) - Cached]
            F4_DP --> F3_DP
            F4_DP --> F2_DP[F(2)]
        end
    ~~~
    *Caption: DP avoids re-computing F(3) by caching its result.*

    **The DP Transition (Climbing Stairs Problem):**
    If `dp[i]` is the number of ways to reach step `i`, you can reach it from step `i-1` or `i-2`. This gives the transition:
    $$ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] $$

    **Python Implementation (Memoization):**
    Python's `functools.lru_cache` is a decorator that makes memoization trivial.

    ~~~python
    from functools import lru_cache

    # Fibonacci with memoization
    # Time Complexity: O(n) - each number from 1 to n is computed once.
    # Space Complexity: O(n) - for the recursion stack and cache.

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fib(n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2:
            return n
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

    print(fib(40)) # Calculates instantly
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** If you see a recursive solution that has overlapping subproblems, you can optimize it with DP. Start with a top-down memoized solution, as it's often more intuitive to write.

### Union-Find

*   **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Imagine you have a box of Lego bricks and you want to keep track of which bricks are connected to each other in different clumps. The Union-Find data structure (also called Disjoint Set Union or DSU) is perfect for this. It tracks a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.

*   **Demonstration:**
    It has two primary operations:
    1.  **`find(i)`:** Determine which subset an element `i` belongs to. This can be done by returning a "representative" or "root" item for that set.
    2.  **`union(i, j)`:** Join the two subsets that elements `i` and `j` belong to.

    This structure is often represented as a forest, where each tree is a subset. The root of the tree is the representative.

    **Visualizing a Union Operation:**

    ~~~mermaid
    graph TD
        subgraph Before Union(A, E)
            A --> B;
            B --> C;
            E --> F;
        end
        subgraph After Union(A, E)
            A2[A] --> B2[B];
            B2 --> C2[C];
            E2[E] --> F2[F];
            A2 --> E2;
        end
    ~~~
    *Caption: To union the sets containing A and E, we can make the root of one tree a child of the other.*

    **Python Implementation:** A simple implementation uses an array `parent` where `parent[i]` stores the parent of element `i`.

    ~~~python
    # Union-Find with Path Compression and Union by Size
    # Time Complexity: Nearly constant time on average for find and union, O(α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function.
    # Space Complexity: O(n)

    class UnionFind:
        def __init__(self, size: int):
            self.parent = list(range(size))
            self.size = [1] * size

        def find(self, i: int) -> int:
            if self.parent[i] == i:
                return i
            # Path compression
            self.parent[i] = self.find(self.parent[i])
            return self.parent[i]

        def union(self, i: int, j: int):
            root_i = self.find(i)
            root_j = self.find(j)
            if root_i != root_j:
                # Union by size
                if self.size[root_i] < self.size[root_j]:
                    root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i
                self.parent[root_j] = root_i
                self.size[root_i] += self.size[root_j]

    uf = UnionFind(10)
    uf.union(1, 2)
    uf.union(2, 5)
    # find(1) == find(5) will be True
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** When you need to dynamically track connectivity between elements, such as in Kruskal's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees or to find the number of connected components in a graph, Union-Find is the ideal tool.

## The Python Playbook: Tips, Tricks, & Standard Libraries

Python's extensive standard library is a significant advantage in timed assessments. Knowing the right tool for the job can save you valuable time and simplify your code. This section is a quick-reference guide to the most valuable utilities.

### List Comprehensions & Generators

*   **Use Case:** Creating a new list based on an existing one. It's more concise and often faster than a `for` loop.
*   **Snippet:**
    ~~~python
    # Square all even numbers from 0 to 9
    squares = [x*x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
    # squares -> [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
    ~~~

### `collections.Counter`

*   **Use Case:** Quickly counting hashable objects (like characters in a string or elements in a list).
*   **Snippet:**
    ~~~python
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter("abracadabra")
    # counts -> Counter({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'r': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1})
    most_common = counts.most_common(1) # -> [('a', 5)]
    ~~~

### `collections.deque`

*   **Use Case:** A double-ended queue perfect for implementing both stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO) with $O(1)$ appends and pops from either end.
*   **Snippet:**
    ~~~python
    from collections import deque
    q = deque([1, 2, 3])
    q.append(4)       # Enqueue right
    q.popleft()       # Dequeue left (returns 1)
    # q -> deque([2, 3, 4])
    ~~~

### `collections.defaultdict`

*   **Use Case:** A dictionary that provides a default value for a key that does not exist, avoiding `KeyError` checks. Especially useful for building adjacency lists.
*   **Snippet:**
    ~~~python
    from collections import defaultdict
    # Group words by their first letter
    s = [('yellow', 1), ('blue', 2), ('yellow', 3)]
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for k, v in s:
        d[k].append(v)
    # d -> defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'yellow': [1, 3], 'blue': [2]})
    ~~~

### `heapq` Module

*   **Use Case:** Implements a min-heap, giving you efficient access to the smallest element. Use it for "Top K" problems or priority-based algorithms like Dijkstra's.
*   **Snippet:**
    ~~~python
    import heapq
    data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
    heapq.heapify(data) # Transform list into a heap, in-place, in O(n)
    smallest = heapq.heappop(data) # Pop and return smallest item (0)
    ~~~

### `bisect` Module

*   **Use Case:** Provides binary search functionality for sorted lists, allowing for $O(\log n)$ insertions and lookups.
*   **Snippet:**
    ~~~python
    import bisect
    sorted_list = [10, 20, 30]
    bisect.insort_left(sorted_list, 25) # Insert item in sorted order
    # sorted_list -> [10, 20, 25, 30]
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** Familiarize yourself with these tools. Using `Counter` for frequency maps or `deque` for queues isn't just cleaner—it's a signal to interviewers that you know the standard library well.

## Practice Sets: Sharpen Your Sword

Theory is essential, but practice is where mastery is forged. This section contains a curated set of problems that map to the concepts we've discussed. For each problem, actively try to solve it first before looking at the hints.

### Problem 1: Two Sum

*   **Statement:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
*   **Tags:** `Easy`, `Array`, `Hash Map`

<details>
<summary>Hint 1: Brute Force</summary>
The simplest approach is to check every possible pair of numbers. How would you write the loops for that? What would the time complexity be?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2: Optimizing the Search</summary>
For each element `x` in the array, you are looking for another element `y` such that `x + y = target`. This means `y = target - x`. How can you quickly check if `y` exists in the array?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3: The Right Data Structure</summary>
A hash map provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups. Can you use a hash map to store the numbers you've seen so far and their indices?
</details>

*   **Reference Python Solution:**

    ~~~python
    from typing import List

    def two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        """
        Finds two numbers in a list that sum to a target value.

        Time Complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the list once. Each dictionary
                         lookup and insertion is O(1) on average.
        Space Complexity: O(n) - In the worst case, we store all n elements in the hash map.
        """
        num_to_index: dict[int, int] = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], i]
            num_to_index[num] = i
        return [] # Should not be reached based on problem statement
    ~~~

*   **Takeaway:** This problem is the canonical example of the time-space tradeoff. By using extra space (a hash map), we can reduce the time complexity from a brute-force $O(n^2)$ to a much more efficient linear $O(n)$.

## Timing & Strategy: Mastering the Clock

A correct solution is great, but a correct solution within the time limit is what gets you to the next round.

1.  **Read Carefully (5 minutes):** Read the problem statement twice. Seriously. Misunderstanding the prompt is a common and costly error. Identify constraints, inputs, and expected outputs.
2.  **Clarify & Example (5 minutes):** Ask clarifying questions (even to yourself). Work through a small example by hand. This solidifies your understanding and can reveal edge cases.
3.  **Brute-Force First (10 minutes):** Don't immediately jump to the most optimal solution. A working brute-force solution is better than a non-working optimal one. Explain its time and space complexity. This shows you have a baseline.
4.  **Optimize (15 minutes):** Now, identify the bottleneck in your brute-force approach. Is it a nested loop? A linear scan that could be a binary search? This is where you apply the patterns from this guide.
5.  **Code & Test (15 minutes):** Write clean, readable code. Use meaningful variable names. Test with your example case and any edge cases you can think of (empty arrays, single elements, etc.).

---

## Final Checklists & Review

Before any assessment, do a quick review.

*   **Mental Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Can I explain the time/space complexity of common operations for Arrays, Hash Maps, and Linked Lists?
    *   [ ] Do I remember the LIFO/FIFO difference for Stacks/Queues?
    *   [ ] Do I know when to use BFS vs. DFS?
    *   [ ] If I see a sorted array, what should I think of first? (Binary Search, Two Pointers)
    *   [ ] If I need to find the "best" contiguous subarray, what pattern applies? (Sliding Window)
*   **Physical Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Stable internet connection.
    *   [ ] Comfortable, distraction-free environment.
    *   [ ] Water and a snack nearby.
